# Assignment 3
The objective is write an application within the constraints of an embedded system targeting the STM32 hardware.
The application uses the touch panel and graphics LCD display for user input and output. Data will be read from
an analog input and viewed on the LCD display. The data can also be stored on the SD card. The application also
makes use of the serial connection.

The application to be implemented is a pulse rate monitor. The analog input is connected to a device that measures
blood oxygen saturation levels and the pulse rate can then be determined. The analog signal generated by the analog
input is to be plotted on the LCD display and optionally stored to the SD card. Data that has been stored on the
SD card can also be retrieved and displayed. A command line interface on the serial port will be used for debugging
and to list the contents of the SD card.
